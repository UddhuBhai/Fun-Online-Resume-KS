## 💼 What Is This?

A full-fledged, no-holds-barred, slightly exaggerated *resume* of **Karan Soni**.

It’s:

* ✨ Half truth
* 🤯 Half exaggeration
* 🔥 Full entertainment

This project is a joke, but Karan’s charisma is very real.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used (Not That It Matters)

* HTML (for structure)
* No frameworks, just raw code and rawer confidence

---

## 🎯 Why It Exists

Because someone had to immortalize **Karan’s vibe** in HTML.
And we weren’t going to wait for the Oscars or TIME magazine to do it.

---

## 🧙 Made By

The ever-loyal, over-caffeinated dev: **Uddhav Matholia**
Built this with friendship, fun, and probably while skipping sleep.

## ⚠️ Legal & Emotional Disclaimer

This is *not* Karan Soni’s actual resume.
It’s a joke — a digital roast with love.
If you’re HR… just close the tab and walk away slowly. 🫣
